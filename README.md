# Car Price Prediction Model 🚗💰

## Overview 📝

Welcome to the `Car-Price-Prediction-ML` repository! This project aims to predict car prices using a machine learning model. We use Python 🐍 and scikit-learn 🛠️ to build a Linear Regression model that takes into account various car features to predict the price tag. 🏷️
